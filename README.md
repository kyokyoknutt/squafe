# SquaFE - Bhopping in Minecraft!
Squake, Fabric Edition: adds Quake CPMA movement to Minecraft!

### Note: this mod is very much a WIP. Do not try to download and use this yet.

I love Squake. It's a mod that adds Quake-style bhopping and other movement tech to Minecraft.
Well, Squake is a Forge mod, which means I can't use it with the more modern Fabric mods.
So, I decided to port Squake to Fabric -- specifically, the updated "SPMquake" version that adds Challenge Pro Mode movement (which will please Source and GoldSrc fans) and a couple of bonus features like dashing. I also built in the speedometer mod Squeedometer by the same person.
